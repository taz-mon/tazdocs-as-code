## Summary

Curious, research-oriented technical writer with extensive lead-writer experience creating user-focused documentation for complex enterprise software platforms serving diverse audiences:

- Created comprehensive technical documentation for data-centric platforms, covering database configurations, Kafka-based data stream processing, and cloud deployment workflows for software engineering audiences.
- Applied information architecture principles to create a set of Kubernetes deployment configuration documentation (including OpenShift) using PR-based peer reviews for developers. Personally deployed and tested these Kubernetes configurations on multiple Kubernetes platforms (AKS, EKS, GKE) to verify documentation technical accuracy before publication.
- Used customer feedback data and support ticket analytics to identify documentation gaps and drive improvements in fast-paced development cycles.

**I love learning new technologies by logging in and using them.**

## Core Competencies

**Platform Documentation:** Complex data-centric systems, deployment workflows, UI-based configurations, cross-functional team coordination

**Data & Security Systems:** Database architecture, data operations, relational database configurations, authentication (MFA, SAML SSO, OIDC, SCIM), RBAC/ABAC configurations

**Multi-Audience Content:** Technical administrators, end-users, developers - structured content using variables and metadata for context-specific delivery making some content ready for AI agents action; familiarity with Power BI and ZoomAnalytics site statistics

**Documentation Tools:** Oxygen XML Editor (DITA) with AI integration, very knowledgeable about content re-use through conrefs; MadCap Flare, Markdown in Visual Studio Code

**Cloud & Infrastructure:** Kubernetes, Docker, Azure (AKS), AWS (EKS), Google Cloud, system deployment documentation

**Version Control & Collaboration:** Git/GitHub PR workflows, branch merging, peer reviews, documentation build integrity processes

**Agile Development Practices:** Scope, schedule, and track documentation assignments across goals, products, and versions

## AI-Adoption Initiatives

### Integrated AI into Documentation Workflow

- Implemented AI Positron with GPT-4 in Oxygen XML Editor (DITA) to optimize content creation and evaluate AI-generated suggestions for technical accuracy. Demonstrated to the writing group how to use the default AI Positron Assistant Samples to check new writing content and experimented with improving the default examples with the Pega writer voice guidelines.
- Adapted content approach to satisfy reading by AI agents, which require explicitly structured specifications and precise step sequences embedded within prose to execute actions without human intervention.

### Pioneered AI-Assisted Content Creation

- Joined cross-functional hackathon project demonstrating how strategic SME interviews combined with AI prompting can accelerate technical documentation development. The project utilized Pega's internal AI/ML search tool with RAG integration to transform video transcripts into a thorough and comprehensive How-To article.
- Developed and refined prompting techniques to create well-structured outlines for complex use-case documentation, reducing content creation time while maintaining technical accuracy.

## Experience

### Pegasystems, Inc.

**Senior/Principal Writer:** July 2020 - August 2025  
**Senior Technical Writer:** January 2016 - June 2020

As lead feature writer, collaborated with teammates, product owners (POs), and software engineering subject matter experts (SMEs) in a global team environment from Hyderabad, India and Krakow, Poland and across the US:

- Wrote installation, upgrade, patch and hotfix documentation over multiple minor release cycles for Pega Platform software. Collaborated directly with engineering teams to investigate and document complex data processing workflows, including Kafka data stream configurations and database integration procedures.
- Logged into systems and wrote articles visible only to system administrators, describing account management tasks for a subscriber-based software product.
- Created developer-focused code examples and configuration snippets for Kubernetes deployments, similar to API documentation for implementation guidance.
- Managed content for Pega Cloud deployments over a multi-year period. Articles included support-related information, such as requirements to submit support requests to complete cloud configurations. Worked with cloud engineers to document options for integrating Pega Cloud with cloud-based and enterprise solutions.
- Documented a set of client-managed cloud runbooks to deploy Pega software using Helm-based configurations in Kubernetes environments, including Azure (AKS), AWS (EKS), Google (GCP), and Red Hat (OpenShift deployed on EKS). Applying information architecture principles, worked with engineering to secure system access to personally complete deployments.
- Used customer feedback and support ticket analysis to identify documentation gaps and prioritize content improvements across multiple release cycles.
- Reviewed internal AI search tools results to test documentation alignment.
- Led a cross-functional initiative to define high-level support terminology for the entire company, leading to improved AI-based searches for support-specific details.
- Regularly reviewed and edited engineering's client-facing documentation changes to Helm charts in GitHub pull request reviews to ensure all changes met Pega's technical writing standards.
- Mentored interns and junior writers, using both peer reviews and one-on-one interactions to teach and assist with DITA writing nuances.
- Proactively helped resolve documentation build issues to help the tools team; this effort is now a multi-writer, build-integrity review process.

### Egenera, Inc.

**Documentation Specialist:** 2000 to 2016

Worked with key staff and logged into test systems to document hardware virtualization when it was just beginning to become an industry standard. Accomplishments:

- Created configuration guides for Administrators, release notes, and context-sensitive help for software products over 12 cycles.
- Created a hardware-oriented runbook for installing a turn-key hardware datacenter solution on which a self-contained rack-server-based deployment of Xterity could run.
- Developed a WebWorks template to enable a single writer to create three manpage formats (PDF, HTML, and groff) from a single FrameMaker source book file.
