## Summary

Collaborative, research-oriented technical writer with extensive lead-writer experience creating developer-focused documentation for complex enterprise platforms. Career progression from Linux-based virtual hardware documentation to enterprise software platforms demonstrates ability to quickly master diverse technical systems and accelerate developer success. Since 2023, using AI to enhance workflow efficiencies.

**Core methodology:** Learn technology by direct implementation and testing, ensuring documentation reflects real-world developer experience rather than theoretical specifications. This hands-on approach identifies gaps between engineering intent and user reality. Very proficient in Git/GitHub content management, including merging and repairing conflicts for peers.

**Seeking:** Hands-on, docs-as-code technical writer creating developer guides and API documentation using modern toolchains and collaborative workflows. Prefer companies in the MLOps infrastructure toolchain.

**Recent initiatives:**

* **API Documentation Readiness:** Completed REST API certification with hands-on Postman testing and OpenAPI/Swagger documentation creation
* **Docs-as-Code Implementation:** Built Docusaurus site demonstrating GitHub workflow management, markdown authoring, and automated content generation. Worked with Claude AI to customize CSS for modern responsive design across light/dark modes
* **Enterprise Platform Documentation:** Created comprehensive technical documentation for data-centric platforms, including database configurations, Kafka data streams, and cloud deployment workflows
* **Technical Verification Leadership:** Personally deployed and validated Kubernetes configurations across AKS, EKS, GKE, and OpenShift platforms, ensuring accuracy through direct testing using GitHub PRs
* **Data-Driven Improvement:** Identified documentation gaps using customer feedback and support analytics to drive iterative improvements in fast-paced development cycles

## Core Competencies

* **Developer Tools & Docs-as-Code:**
  - Git/GitHub PR workflows (branch management, merge conflict resolution, peer reviews, documentation build integrity process), Markdown authoring, static site generators (Docusaurus), GitHub Actions and Workflows for automating builds, familiarity with AsciiDoc tagging structure
  - Command line proficiency (Linux/PowerShell), Visual Studio Code integration
  - API endpoint testing with Postman; Swagger code reviews
* **Technical Verification & Testing:**
  - Hands-on deployment and validation of documented procedures across the latest available environment
  - Personal testing of configuration workflows to ensure accuracy before publication
* **Cloud Infrastructure & Enterprise Platforms:**
  - Helm (YAML)-based deployments, Docker, Kubernetes deployments (Azure AKS, AWS EKS, Google Cloud GKE, RedHat OpenShift)
  - Database configurations, authentication systems (OAuth 2.0, SAML SSO, OIDC), platform installation, upgrade, patch, and hotfix
* **Documentation Tools:**
  - Oxygen XML Editor (DITA) with AI Positron integration, MadCap Flare, Markdown in Visual Studio Code
  - Expert in content re-use and Glossary setup through XML-based conrefs, content testing and validation
* **Agile Collaboration:**
  - Cross-functional team coordination, documentation assignments across product cycles, dynamic re-prioritization of work when needed
* **AI Integration:**
  - Implemented AI Positron with GPT-4 in DITA workflows for content optimization and technical accuracy validation
  - Led cross-functional initiative defining support terminology to improve AI-based search capabilities
  - Applied AI tools for workflow efficiency while maintaining documentation quality standards

## Experience

**Recent initiatives** | September 2025  
*Docs-as-Code Implementation*

* Configured Docusaurus static site generator; customized CSS with Claude AI for attractive, responsive design across light/dark modes and mobile devices.
* Implemented automated documentation builds and deployment based on a GitHub Actions workflow.

*API Reference experiment*

* Developed JavaScript application with AI assistance and extracted comprehensive API documentation conforming to OpenAPI specifications.
* Integrated interactive API documentation using Redocusaurus 2.5.0, creating unified developer experience combining narrative guides with live API reference.

*AsciiDoc edition*

* Created AsciiDoc version of resume demonstrating markup language versatility.
* Added AsciiDoc plugin to Docusaurus for seamless rendering and updated CSS with Claude Code to customize output formatting.

**Pegasystems, Inc. |** January 2016 - August 2025  
*Senior writer - 5 years | Principal writer - 4 years*

As lead feature writer, collaborated with teammates, product owners (POs), and software engineering subject matter experts (SMEs) in a global team environment from India, Poland, and across the US:

* For most assignments, logged into a system or a support ticket to review the UI or issue to duplicate the end-user experience.
* Created developer-focused code examples and configuration snippets in runbooks for Helm-based configurations in Kubernetes environments, including Azure (AKS), AWS (EKS), Google (GCP), and Red Hat (OpenShift deployed on EKS). Worked with engineering to secure system access to personally complete deployments and document environment-specific configurations.
* Led a cross-functional initiative to define high-level support terminology for the entire company, leading to improved AI-based searches for support-specific details.
* Logged into systems and wrote articles visible only to system administrators, describing account management tasks for a subscriber-based software product.
* Regularly reviewed and edited engineering's client-facing documentation changes to Helm charts in GitHub pull request reviews to ensure all changes met Pega's technical writing standards.
* Wrote installation, upgrade, patch and hotfix documentation across multiple release cycles for Pega Platform software
* Collaborated directly with engineering teams to investigate and document complex data processing workflows, including Kafka data stream configurations and database integration procedures
* Used customer feedback and support ticket analysis to identify documentation gaps and prioritize content improvements across multiple release cycles.
* Managed content for Pega Cloud deployments over a multi-year period. Articles included support-related information, such as requirements to submit support requests to complete cloud configurations. Worked with cloud engineers to document options for integrating Pega Cloud with cloud-based and enterprise solutions.
* Mentored interns and junior writers, using both peer reviews and one-on-one interactions to teach and assist with DITA writing nuances.
* Proactively helped resolve documentation build issues to help the documentation tools team; this effort is now a multi-writer, build-integrity review process.

**Egenera, Inc.**  
**Documentation Specialist:** 2000 to 2016

Joined start-up Egenera at the dawn of hardware virtualization, developing expertise in documenting complex infrastructure systems. This 15-year foundation established my core methodology of learning new technologies through direct implementation‚Äîan approach that evolved from documenting experimental hardware to mastering enterprise software platforms. Key progression and accomplishments:

* Documented a turn-key datacenter solution (a runbook) which required deep understanding of hardware, networking, and software integration‚Äîskills that translated directly to cloud infrastructure documentation.
* Created comprehensive configuration guides, release notes, and context-sensitive help across 12 product release cycles.
* Documented administrator guides that bridged hardware and software installation instruction covering blade-server hardware port mapping to hypervisor software. This content included wiring diagrams and steps to install Linux and software on bare metal servers.
* Developed a WebWorks template to enable a single writer to create three manpage formats (PDF, HTML, and groff) from a single FrameMaker source book file.
