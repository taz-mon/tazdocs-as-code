# API experiment

The Johann von Neumann (JVN)-inspired chatbot project was a fun way to learn how to design APIs to get work done in a context that I, as a technical writer, could relate to.

I imagined several transactions that a brilliant but cranky chatbot could create in response to getting bored. I took the project to Claude AI and together we made a solid Javascript application then extracted API documentation, making sure that it conformed to OpenAPI specifications.

To see the  API documentation, click [JVN Chatbot API (1.0.0)](/api/jvn-chatbot). I do this by exposing the Redocusaurus preset for Docusaurus. For more information, see [Redocusaurus](https://redocusaurus.vercel.app/docs/). As long as you format the documnetation to OpenAPI standards, Redocusuarus presents a nicely formatted set of documentation.
