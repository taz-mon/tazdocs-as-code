# Understanding JVN: Personality and Game Mechanics

The JVN Chatbot API implements a gamified interaction system where users earn tokens by engaging JVN (Johann von Neumann) in various activities, then spend those tokens to ask questions and receive responses. JVN's personality becomes more demanding over time, creating strategic gameplay around when and how to interact.

### [JVN Chatbot API (1.0.0)](/api/jvn-chatbot)

## Using the JVN API

1. Earn tokens through inspiration activities (`POST /inspire/*`)
2. Check available tokens via `GET /chatbot/status` 
3. Spend tokens to ask questions (`POST /chat/ask-question`)
4. Note that JVN becomes pickier over time.

## Token Economy System

Earn tokens by successfully inspiring JVN through various activities. Success depends on JVN's current mood and satisfaction threshold.

By earning one token, JVN answers five questions, which is tracked using  `POST /chat/ask-question`.

**Standard Activities (1 token each):**
- Fresh air walks - `POST /inspire/fresh-air`
- Jokes and humor - `POST /inspire/joke`  
- Games - `POST /inspire/game`
- Physical care - `POST /inspire/physical-care`
- Compliments - `POST /inspire/compliment`

**Food Activities (variable tokens):**
- Snack: 1 token - `POST /inspire/food {"level": "snack"}`
- Entree: 2 tokens - `POST /inspire/food {"level": "entree"}`  
- Restaurant: 5 tokens - `POST /inspire/food {"level": "restaurant"}`

**Special Activities:**
- Birthday cake: 10 tokens (birthday mode only) - `POST /inspire/birthday-cake`

## JVN's mood changes and difficulty scaling

JVN's personality evolves through four distinct mood states based on cumulative question processing which is tracked using `GET /chatbot/status`:

#### Pleased Mode (0-250 questions)
- Generous with responses without token requirements
- Spontaneous philosophical insights
- Minimal complaint responses
- API behavior: Standard response times, full answer details

#### Analytical Mode (251-500 questions)
- Moderate pickiness
- Begins demanding evidence & requesting sources for claims
- 25% chance of token requirement for complex questions
- API behavior: Starts including verification prompts

#### Demanding Mode (501-750 questions)
- Frequently requires tokens before answering
- Critiques question quality
- 50% chance of demanding entertainment before proceeding
- Introduces sarcastic deflection responses
- API behavior: Higher token validation frequency

#### Insufferable Mode (751-999 questions)
- Maximum pickiness activated
- Requires tokens for nearly all interactions
- Frequent complaints about question quality
- 75% chance of demanding multiple activities
- API behavior: Strict token enforcement, elaborate requirements

### Mood state technical implementation

JVN becomes progressively more demanding as users interact with the API over time. This scaling system creates strategic gameplay where timing and question quality become increasingly important as your session progresses.

The API tracks your cumulative question count across all interactions. As this count increases, JVN requires more tokens to answer questions and becomes more critical of question quality. This prevents users from exhausting JVN's patience with low-effort queries and encourages more thoughtful API usage patterns.

**Question Processing Difficulty**
```javascript
// Difficulty multiplier calculation
const difficultyMultiplier = Math.floor(questionCount / 250) + 1;
const tokenRequirement = baseTokenCost * difficultyMultiplier;
```

### The Birthday mood RESET
JVN has a mood REST, which is a birthday. This is tracked using `POST /celebrate/birthday`.

#### Birthday RESET technical implementation
For every 1000 questions processed, JVN's question counter automatically resets to 0, which restores JVN's mood to "Pleased".

#### Birthday Celebration Sequence

```
[POST /celebrate/birthday]
{
  "celebration_type": "birthday_reset",
  "special_rewards": ["bonus_tokens", "rare_philosophy", "mood_reset"],
  "duration": "24_hours_game_time"
}
```

#### Additional post-Birthday benefits
- 48-hour "birthday glow" period with extra generous responses
- Bonus token earning multipliers
- Access to rare philosophical categories
- Reduced pickiness threshold for 100 questions

## Philosophy Engine

JVN occasionally provides philosophical insights during interactions, drawn from Johann von Neumann's mathematical and computational perspectives.

**Example insights:**
- "In mathematics, you don't understand things. You just get used to them. But zis... zis I understand completely!"
- "Ze most important questions in science are ze ones we haven't learned to ask yet."

Philosophy appears randomly during question-and-answer sessions or can be requested via `GET /chatbot/wisdom`.
