# Why docs-as-code?

Documentation-as-code is a process writers and developers use to make changes locally and test them before pushing them to a live documentation site. To get started, you need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as Visual Code Studio, a static site generator, a Git repository, a change management system like Github to set up workflows, and a hosting platform. 

## Why do I, a technical writer, use docs-as-code?

To impress my friends and family by typing something in a window of my computer and showing off how it makes the letters appear like magic on the internet. I call it "Command-line and Teller".

## Use the site as my resume

I created this site using Docusaraus, by following this great tutorial, [How to Set Up Documentation as Code with Docusaurus and GitHub Actions](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/set-up-docs-as-code-with-docusaurus-and-github-actions/). Follow it to learn about this and related tools which technical writers can explore to learn how to adopt to today's technical writing economy. The field is changing and being familiar with static doc site generators seems important. I believe it brings up your tech tools game.

You may not be using it at your current job, but if you want to find newer tech writing roles, you should be on the lookout for challenges like this. Trying these tools shows that you aren't sitting back, relying on old technology to document today's technology. This is one step in showing you that I see how the landscape is changing, and I am trying to change with it. 

## Linux computers

This is a great place to get started with a native Linux computer>> [System76 logo](https://system76.com/). Something to think about. In a day or two you'll wonder why you hesitated.
