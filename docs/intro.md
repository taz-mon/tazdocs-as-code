# Why docs-as-code?

Documentation-as-code is a simple process to make change locally and check them out before you push them to your docs live site. To accomplish this, you need an IDE, a static site generator, a Git repository, CI/CD to set up workflows, and a hosting platform. 

## Why do I, a technical writer, use docs-as-code?

To impress my friends and family by typing something in a window of my computer and showing off how it makes the letters appear like magic on the internet. I call it "Command-line and Teller".

## Use the site as my resume

I created this site using Docusaraus, by following this great tutorial, [How to Set Up Documentation as Code with Docusaurus and GitHub Actions](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/set-up-docs-as-code-with-docusaurus-and-github-actions/). If you are curious, you should read it to learn about tools many technical writers kinda should know about if they want to participate in today's technical writing economy. The field is changing and being familiar wiht static doc site generators seems not only important but I believe it brings up your tech tools game substantially.

You may not be using it at your current job, but if you want to find newer tech writing roles, it seems pretty important. And trying these tools that are easy to experiment with shows you aren't sitting back, relying on old technology to document the stuff used to be standard but isn't anymore.

## Linux computers

This is a great place to get started with a native Linux computer>> [System76 logo](https://system76.com/). Something to think about. In a day or two you'll wonder why you hesitated.
